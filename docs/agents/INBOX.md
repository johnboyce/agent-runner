# INBOX (Raw Dump / Scratchpad)

This document is a free-form scratchpad for all new ideas, raw observations, agent outputs, logs, and any unprocessed thoughts related to the Agent Runner platform.

Nothing in here is considered actionable work. Items from the INBOX must be triaged and formally moved to `TASKS.md` before any agent or developer can begin work on them.

---

Drop unprocessed notes, agent output, logs, and ideas here.
Nothing needs to be “clean.” We triage items from here into TASKS.md.
