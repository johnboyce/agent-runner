# Project Plan: Agent Runner

This document provides a clear overview of the Agent Runner project, including its current status, completed tasks, and future roadmap.

## 1. Current Project Status

**Agent Runner** is currently in an **active development** phase. The core infrastructure and console are stable and functional, but the agent's intelligence and capabilities are still under development.

### ✅ **What's Working Right Now**

-   **Agent Runner API**: All REST endpoints are operational, with 100% test coverage.
-   **Background Worker**: The worker can poll for `QUEUED` runs, claim them atomically, and simulate execution.
-   **Console UI**: The dashboard, run detail page, and run controls (pause, resume, stop) are fully functional with real-time polling.
-   **Create Run Modal**: The "Create Run" feature is complete, with all form fields working.
-   **Database**: The SQLite database schema is up-to-date and all tables are in use.
-   **Event Logging**: The system correctly logs events to the database and displays them in the UI.
-   **Service Status Indicators**: The UI shows the status of the Worker, Forgejo, and Taiga services.

### 🚧 **What Needs Work**

-   **Real LLM Integration**: The agent logic is not yet connected to an actual LLM like Ollama.
-   **Actual Agent Intelligence**: The agent's execution is currently simulated and does not perform real work.
-   **File System Operations**: Agents cannot yet read from or write to the file system.
-   **Git Integration**: There is no integration with a Git server like Forgejo for managing branches, commits, or diffs.
-   **Multi-Agent Coordination**: The system does not yet support the coordination of multiple agents.
-   **Forgejo/Taiga Workflow Integration**: There is no integration with Forgejo or Taiga for project management workflows.

## 2. Completed Tasks (Milestones)

-   **Milestone 1: Local Stack Setup**: The initial setup of the local development environment, including the Agent Runner API, Console UI, and SQLite database.
-   **Milestone 2: Console MVP**: The implementation of the minimum viable product for the Console UI, including the run dashboard, detail page, and basic run controls.
-   **Milestone 3: Create Run Modal**: The implementation of the "Create Run" feature, allowing users to create new agent runs from the UI.
-   **Milestone 4: Agent Execution Simulation**: The implementation of the background worker and the simulation of agent execution, including event logging.

## 3. Pending Tasks & Roadmap

This section outlines the planned features and improvements for the Agent Runner project.

### Phase 1: Core Agent Capabilities (In Progress)

-   [ ] **Integrate with multiple LLM providers (Gemini, Claude, Ollama)**: Connect the agent to multiple LLM providers to enable flexible, real LLM-powered execution. *Note: The user has expressed a preference for using "Claude Coder" for development tasks on this project.*
-   [ ] **Implement File System Operations**: Allow agents to read and write files on the local file system.
-   [ ] **Basic Git Operations**: Implement basic Git operations, such as creating branches and committing changes.
-   [ ] **Artifact Management**: Implement a system for managing artifacts generated by agent runs.

### Phase 2: Advanced Agent Features

-   [ ] **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Implement a system for coordinating the execution of multiple agents.
-   [ ] **Web Browsing Capabilities**: Allow agents to browse the web to gather information.
-   [ ] **Long-Term Memory**: Implement a long-term memory solution for agents to retain information across runs.

### Phase 3: Workflow and Integration

-   [ ] **Forgejo Integration**: Integrate with Forgejo to automate Git-related tasks.
-   [ ] **Taiga Integration**: Integrate with Taiga for project management and issue tracking.
-   [ ] **Custom Workflows**: Allow users to define custom workflows for their agents.

### Phase 4: Production Readiness

-   [ ] **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement a robust authentication and authorization system.
-   [ ] **Scalability Improvements**: Improve the scalability of the system to handle a large number of concurrent runs.
-   [ ] **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement a comprehensive monitoring and alerting system.
-   [ ] **Deployment Automation**: Automate the deployment of the Agent Runner to various environments.
